            <p>I am a twenty-two year old digital marketing enthusiast. Originally from Poland, currently living in Finland. I graduated Management with Marketing Specialisation and Businesses Law at Adam Mickiewicz University and Law at University of Eastern Finland. You will ask how did I go from law to marketing? Well, from the beginning of my studies I discovered my love for marketing and since then, that is more than 3 years, I have been gaining experience. I have worked in many places, through global corporations, to various startups to my own business.</p>
            <p>My expertise extends to managing entire marketing campaigns from inception to completion. I am capable of creating digital assets, content, and effectively leading a team and whole communities, while also utilizing outsourcing to achieve optimal results. Additionally, I am proficient in utilizing a range of tools to create graphics, design, and manage websites, such as Figma, Webflow, Wordpress, Adobe, iMovie, Canva, and LighTracer.</p>
            <p>While I have achieved already many experience in my young career, I still aspire to learn and grow under the guidance of more experienced mentors in the industry. I have a true passion for digital marketing and with my knowledge and skilled team of specialists, I am confident in achieving great results.</p>
