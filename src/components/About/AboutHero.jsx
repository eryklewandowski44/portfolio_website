            <p>I am a twenty-two year old digital marketing enthusiast. Originally from Poland, currently living in Finland. I graduated Management with Marketing Specialisation and Businesses Law at Adam Mickiewicz University and Law at University of Eastern Finland. You will ask how did I go from law to marketing? Well, from the beginning of my studies I discovered my love for marketing and since then, that is more than 3 years, I have been gaining experience. I have worked in many places, through global corporations, to various startups to my own business.</p>
            <p>I want to create new creative awesome campaigns in digital world. My latest project is a Rens x The Sandbox collaboration. The results of the campaign were very stunning, and the moment when I saw satisfied fans bragging about their NFTs, elements of characters that we designed with team or physical items was indescribable to me.</p>
            <p>With projects I always give all of myself. I often manage international teams, so I know how to adjust cooperation strategies. Besides, I like to optimize project processes with the help of many modern tools and AI.</p>
            <p>Don't hesitate to contact me :)</p>
